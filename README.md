# Repository Name: sps-quality

## Overview
This repository contains the data and Python scripts associated with the scientific article titled "The Challenge of Quickly Determining the Quality of a Single-Photon Source". The article cautions against overconfidence when estimating the quality of a quantum dot intended to be a single-photon source (SPS) quantum dot. It highlights uncertainty statistics derived from experimental datasets that are supplemented by data augmentation. The scripts provided here demonstratively implement these procedures of data augmentation and uncertainty analysis.

## Requirements
- Anaconda (Python 3.x)
- Required packages:
  - `numpy`
  - `scipy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `pandas`

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SinglePhotonSourceQuality.git
Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it.

2. Navigate to the repository's directory:
cd SinglePhotonSourceQuality

3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate # On Windows, use env\Scripts\activate

4. Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Ensure that you have activated the virtual environment (if used).

2. The repository provides several Python scripts for different analyses and visualizations. Here are the main scripts:

- `analyze_photon_data.py`: This script performs the analysis of the photon data collected from the single-photon source. It calculates relevant metrics and generates visualizations. To run this script, execute the following command:
  ```
  python analyze_photon_data.py
  ```
  The script will generate the output files in the `output` directory.

- `plot_results.py`: This script generates plots based on the analysis results obtained from the `analyze_photon_data.py` script. Run the following command to execute it:
  ```
  python plot_results.py
  ```
  The generated plots will be saved in the `output/plots` directory.

3. Feel free to explore and modify the scripts according to your specific requirements. Each script contains detailed comments to guide you through the code and its functionalities.

## Data
The `data\InGaAs-GaAs QDs\FI-SEQUR project demonstrator sample` directory contains the experimental data generated by interferometry measurements of an intended SPS. Their format is described in the paper. These files serve as input for the `mc.py` script, which augments them with a data-generative procedure (referred to as a Monte Carlo method), fits their histograms to derive a metric for SPS quality, and compiles their uncertainty statistics.

## Saves
The `saves\InGaAs-GaAs QDs\FI-SEQUR project demonstrator sample` directory contains pickle files storing the uncertainty statistics generated by the `mc.py` script. These files serve as input for the `plot_paper.py` script, which visualises aggregate results.

## Results
The `results` directory contains plots of aggregate results generated by the `plot_paper.py` script. These are produced for the paper. The `saves\InGaAs-GaAs QDs\FI-SEQUR project demonstrator sample` directory contains sample histogram plots generated by the `mc.py` script.
