# Repository Name: sps-quality

## Overview
This repository contains the data and Python scripts associated with the scientific article titled "The Challenge of Quickly Determining the Quality of a Single-Photon Source". The article cautions against overconfidence when estimating the quality of a quantum dot intended to be a single-photon source (SPS) quantum dot. It highlights uncertainty statistics derived from experimental datasets that are supplemented by data augmentation. The scripts provided here demonstratively implement these procedures of data augmentation and uncertainty analysis.

## Requirements
- Anaconda (Python 3.x)
- Required packages:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `pandas`
  - `lmfit`
  - `numdifftools`
  - `seaborn`

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/UTS-CASLab/sps-quality.git
```
Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it.

2. Install Anaconda by following the instructions from the official Anaconda website:
https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

3. Open Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (macOS/Linux) and install the required packages:
```
conda install -c conda-forge numpy matplotlib pandas lmfit numdifftools seaborn
```

4. Navigate to the repository's directory:
```
cd sps-quality
```

## Usage
The repository provides several Python scripts for data analysis and visualisation. Here are the main scripts:

- `mc.py`: This script loops through select experimental interferometry datasets stored in the `data` directory, fits their histograms, bootstraps new data samples from these best fits, fits histograms of the bootstrapped samples, and compiles statistics for the fit parameters, including SPS quality. The statistics are saved to .pkl files in appropriate `saves` sub-directories. Sample fits are also plotted and saved in appropriate `results` sub-directories.
  To run this script, execute the following command:
  ```
  python mc.py
  ```
  Note that pre-existing .pkl files will force `mc.py` to skip over data augmentation for the settings they represent, so delete them in the appropriate `saves` subdirectories if fresh data augmentation and sample-fit plots are desired.

- `plot_paper.py`: This script generates plots based on the fit-parameter statistics obtained from the `mc.py` script, saving them in the top level of the `results` directory.
  To run this script, execute the following command:
  ```
  python plot_paper.py
  ```

## Data
The `data\InGaAs-GaAs QDs\FI-SEQUR project demonstrator sample` directory contains the experimental data specific to the paper generated by interferometry measurements of an intended SPS. Their format is described in the paper. These files serve as input for the `mc.py` script, which augments them with a data-generative procedure (referred to as a Monte Carlo method), fits their histograms to derive a metric for SPS quality, and compiles their uncertainty statistics.

## Saves
The `saves\InGaAs-GaAs QDs\FI-SEQUR project demonstrator sample` directory contains pickle files storing the uncertainty statistics generated by the `mc.py` script. These files serve as input for the `plot_paper.py` script, which visualises aggregate results.

## Results
The `results` directory contains plots of aggregate results generated by the `plot_paper.py` script. These are produced for the paper. The `saves\InGaAs-GaAs QDs\FI-SEQUR project demonstrator sample` directory also contains sample histogram plots generated by the `mc.py` script.
