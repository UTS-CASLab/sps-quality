# Repository Name: SinglePhotonSourceQuality

## Overview
This repository contains the data and Python scripts associated with the scientific article titled "The Challenge of Quickly Determining the Quality of a Single-Photon Source". The article explores the challenges and methods for assessing the quality of a single-photon source efficiently. The scripts provided here demonstrate the implementation of these methods and allow for further experimentation and analysis.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required packages:
  - `numpy`
  - `scipy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `pandas`

## Installation
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SinglePhotonSourceQuality.git
Alternatively, you can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it.

2. Navigate to the repository's directory:
cd SinglePhotonSourceQuality

3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate # On Windows, use env\Scripts\activate

4. Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1. Ensure that you have activated the virtual environment (if used).

2. The repository provides several Python scripts for different analyses and visualizations. Here are the main scripts:

- `analyze_photon_data.py`: This script performs the analysis of the photon data collected from the single-photon source. It calculates relevant metrics and generates visualizations. To run this script, execute the following command:
  ```
  python analyze_photon_data.py
  ```
  The script will generate the output files in the `output` directory.

- `plot_results.py`: This script generates plots based on the analysis results obtained from the `analyze_photon_data.py` script. Run the following command to execute it:
  ```
  python plot_results.py
  ```
  The generated plots will be saved in the `output/plots` directory.

3. Feel free to explore and modify the scripts according to your specific requirements. Each script contains detailed comments to guide you through the code and its functionalities.

## Data
The `data` directory contains the raw data collected from the single-photon source experiments. These files serve as input for the `analyze_photon_data.py` script. You can replace them with your own data or use them as a reference for understanding the input data format.

## Results
The `output` directory will be created when running the scripts. It contains the output files and generated plots. You can refer to these results for further analysis or visualization.
